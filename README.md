# Candy-Challenge
Our app for Chronicle Hackathon 2021

## About the app
Our application provides a unique solution which enables people to get in touch with one another through conquering challenges together. Candy challenge is a social network and productivity platform where users can interact with each other by creating/joining and completing challenges together. Every time users complete a challenge, they will be awarded üç≠candies which they can use for exchanging products in the real life, such as gift cards, vouchers, etc.
